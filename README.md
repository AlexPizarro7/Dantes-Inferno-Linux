# Dantes-Inferno-Linux
This is a text-based (interactive fiction) game based on Dante's Inferno, written in Ubuntu with bash shell script.
This project allowed me to combine my love for literature and programming. Along with familiarizing myself with bash script.

# How to play this game 

### Download the bash shell for Windows 
In Windows PowerShell, type the command: wsl --install    
Be sure to restart your computer after the installation. 

### Download the shell script files 
Download all the files ending with .sh as these are the files containing the game. Place them all in a single directory (folder) wherever you wish. 

### Access the directory inside the bash shell 
Use the cd command in bash to go inside the directory where you downloaded and placed all the game files. 

### Execute the game
After you are in the directory, execute the game in bash by executing the file game-start.sh    You can do this by typing ./game-start.sh in bash.
